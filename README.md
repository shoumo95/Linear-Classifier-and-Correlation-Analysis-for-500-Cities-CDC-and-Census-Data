## Objective

* Use Linear Classification and Principal Component Analysis to implement a Machine Learning Model to Classify Obesity from Census data for 500 cities and Census Tract & County data
* Research on Variation of Classification Performance with variation of feature set 
* Research on Classification Performance with additional non-linear terms in Linear Classification 


## Methods

* Correlation Analysis of Features from Census data with Obesity and include Top 30 Features for classification 
* Merge Census Tract County data with 500 cities data to augment feature set 
* Obtain 400 Training & 100 Test Feature vectors with shuffling from 500 cities database to remove bias
* Implement Linear Classifier with Squared and Cubed Non-Linear terms to enhanced accuracy and use data normalization to optimize performance
* Implement Principal Component Analysis for Obesity Classification
